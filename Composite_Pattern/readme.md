# Why Use the Composite Pattern?

You might wonder why you need the Composite Pattern when you can achieve similar functionality with a `Manager` class, `GeneralManager` class, and `Developer` class, combined with a role management system in the database. Here's why the Composite Pattern might be beneficial and when it could be unnecessary.

## Advantages of the Composite Pattern

### 1. Scalability in Complex Systems
- **Without Composite Pattern**:
  Adding new levels or roles (e.g., `TeamLead`, `Intern`) might require modifying multiple classes or database logic.
- **With Composite Pattern**:
  The tree structure allows you to extend the hierarchy by adding new `Leaf` or `Composite` classes without altering existing code.

### 2. Uniformity of Operations
- **Without Composite Pattern**:
  You need to differentiate between `Manager` and `Developer` roles in your code. For example:
  ```python
  if role == "Developer":
      # Developer-specific action
  elif role == "Manager":
      # Manager-specific action
```
